            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to be an impartial judge between us for thine owne good, and with the noble <hi>Boereans,</hi> bring every doctrine to the Scripture, and be not ſwayed on either ſide, to preſume above that which is written. <note place="margin">Acts 17.11. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

For <hi>Peter,</hi> in the abſence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> lived amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> after the <hi>manner</hi> of the Gentiles, for outward converſation, wholly laying aſide the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies. But when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Jews</hi> came from <hi>James, Peter</hi> did withdraw from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and from the uſe of that <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> of the Goſpel, wherein he had walked with them, and lived again with the <hi>Jews,</hi> after the manner of the Jews, in the uſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>By which practiſe of his, he laid a <hi>ſtumbling block</hi> before the believing Gentiles, giving them occaſion to think and judge, That <hi>Chriſt alone,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>Faith,</hi> was not enough to <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> unleſſe they did alſo come in to live as the <hi>Jews,</hi> after <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>(A) Paul</hi> (who had a very clear knowledg in the myſterie of Chriſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:166419:10"/> and the Goſpel) did exceedingly blame <hi>Peter</hi> for this his <hi>un-even</hi> walking, <hi>(B)</hi> and tels him, that by thus doing, he committed a <hi>greater errour</hi> then he was aware; for hereby he made <hi>Chriſt the Miniſter of ſin.</hi> For, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith, be abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>enough</hi> to all Chriſtians, both for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and that <hi>without</hi> the Law; why doth <hi>Peter</hi> bring the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that had believed on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> back again to the <hi>Law?</hi> Is not this (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) to argue Chriſt of <hi>weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency,</hi> and to make him the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Teacher</hi> of a Doctrine that leaves men ſtill in <hi>ſin,</hi> it not being able to conſer upon them, by it ſelf alone, full, perfect, and ſufficient <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by reaſon <hi>(C)</hi> of this <hi>groſſe miſtake</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> of ſo dangerous a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, <hi>Paul</hi> according to the wiſdome of the Spirit, takes occaſion to diſcourſe of that <hi>great</hi> point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which is the very <hi>marrow</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Goſpel: <hi>(D)</hi> and he ſhows, that we muſt not do the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> thereby to be made <hi>righteous:</hi> but we muſt firſt be made <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> ere we can <hi>do aright</hi> any work of the <hi>Law.</hi> For, as it is not <hi>good fruit</hi> can make a <hi>good tree,</hi> but it is a <hi>good tree</hi> that muſt bring forth <hi>good fruit; (E)</hi> ſo neither are we <hi>made righteous</hi> by <hi>working</hi> righteouſneſſe, but by <hi>receiving</hi> righteouſneſſe, out of which afterwards we <hi>work.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Law,</hi> that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> Righteouſneſſe, but doth not <hi>communicate</hi> Righteouſneſſe, can never <hi>juſtifie</hi> us; But <hi>faith,</hi> that <hi>makes</hi> us righteous before we can <hi>work</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; it is that which <hi>juſtifies</hi> us in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Now to this Doctrine, <hi>Paul</hi> adds his own <hi>Experience</hi> to make all clear: which kind of arguing, though it will not ſatisfie the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> yet it will ſatisfie the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> for mine own part, I muſt profeſſe to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, and to all the world beſides, <hi>(F)</hi> that I am ſo far from ſeeking Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the <hi>Law,</hi> that I am wholly <hi>dead to the Law,</hi> and as a <hi>dead man,</hi> have no more to do with the <hi>Law,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> hath no more to do with <hi>me.

                        <hi>(C)</hi> It is dangerous and unwarrantable diſtinguiſhing upon the Scriptures, without the Scriptures. If that liberty be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged unto men, they will have a bridle in the mouth of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to make it turn, and ſpeak at pleaſure. Evill doers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, are made the objects of Magiſtratical reſtraint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. And the corrupters of Gods truth and worſhip are expreſly called evil doers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. When therefore men manifeſtly appear to be ſuch, they cannot plead or expect exemption from magiſtratical reſtraint by Scripture authority. The Parliament hath lately publiſhed an Act againſt blaſphemy, and revived and enlarged ſome Acts for the due obſervation of the Lords Day; and I think therein have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a duty which belongs to Chriſtian Magiſtrates. Should any attempt to introduce ſurciſme, Paganiſme, Judaiſme or Socinianiſme into our Land, would the governours thereof do well, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> to ſit down and care for none of theſe things? would they be able to ſatisfie their conſcience, that they did ſatisfie their duty towards God, in caſe they ſhould look on, ſtand ſtill, and cry God help. I think there are few who would have a face, though it be much to be feared, that many have a heart to profeſſe ſo much, which is the neceſſary reſult of Mr <hi>Dells</hi> principles: Bleſſed be God that the preſent heads of our State in Parliament, by what they have lately done about the Turkiſh <hi>Alcaron,</hi> and the Sociman Catechiſm, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſuppreſſing of them, have declared themſelves to be of more ſound judgement. I cannot yet otherwiſe apprehend but that they who hold, that Magiſtrates may not at all Judg, and do juſtice, in caſe of manifeſt immediate injury done to God, are not through ſtrength of reaſon, but by reaſon of the Magiſtrates ſtrength only held to an acknowledgement, that they may Judge and do juſtice in point of injury towards men.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:166419:14"/> For the reaſon taken from Gods being alwayes preſent in the world as <hi>moderatour,</hi> and governour himſelf, to prove that he is the immediate Judge <hi>in all things that immediately concern himſelf and his kingdom,</hi> being preſſed home will prove him to be immediate Judg alſo, in all things pertaining to Judgement and Juſtice amongſt men, ſeeing his throne is in the heavens, and his kingdom rules overall, and ſo a fair way will be made to an utter extirpation of Magiſtracy from the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>And as for tender-hearted Magiſtrates, who may be ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered at the uſe of their power, for the ſuppreſſing of ſuch, as in the judgement of their conſcience, regulated by the word of God, are manifeſt and pernicious offenders in ſuch affairs as <hi>immediately concern God and his kingdom;</hi> I would offer theſe things briefly to their judicious conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the tenderneſſe of good Magiſtrates to act for God, will breed no tenderneſſe in evil Magiſtrates to act againſt God, when they have power in their hands.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the abuſe of Magiſtratical authority by evil men, doth not make that authority void in the hands of good men, elſe all authority of Magiſtrates, in things relating as well to men as God, would be extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That whileſt Magiſtrates, not only neglect but refuſe, and that out of conſcience to act for God in all ſuch affairs, as <hi>immediately concern him and his kingdom,</hi> they may provoke him to ſet up others in their ſtead, who will make conſcience to be zealous and valiant for him, his truth and worſhip upon earth, againſt manifeſt offenders. <note place="margin">Ezech. 34.7,8,9,10.

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That it is a fruit of carnal wiſdom in Gods people to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and folly to expect freedom from perſecution for truth, and righteouſneſſe, when wicked men are exalted, ſpecially conſidering that ſuffering patiently and joyfully for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when God calleth them thereunto, is a part of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar happineſs and honour of Gods ſervants upon earth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the nouriſhing of the open corrupters of Gods truth and worſhip, by Magiſtrates in any ſtate, is not only by way of provocation in regard of God, but preparation alſo in regard of men, a very ready courſe to ripen ſuch a ſtate to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:166419:14"/> hotteſt perſecution for truth and righteouſneſſe; <hi>He that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth a ſerpent is likely to be bitten thereby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Law of God is open to the conſciences of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates, as well in things immediately concerning God as men, and they are deputies for God towards men, in relation to his whole Law.</p>
                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="8">8. That Chriſtian Magiſtrates are in the ſame manner to ſeek the happineſſe of their ſtates, as of their own perſons, even by ſeeking firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Ne<expan>

I would but propoſe one queſtion in the fear of God, to the ſerious thoughts of ſuch as would clip the wings of civil Chriſtian Magiſtrates, as to all affairs and offences, how open and odious ſoever, <hi>immediately relating to God and his kingdom.</hi> Why ſhould it be thought more unſutable to Gods goodneſſe, greatneſs, all-filling preſence in the world, and zeal of his own glory, in the time of the Goſpel then of the Law, to have Chriſtian Magiſtrates whom he makes his ſubſtitutes, in the government of ſuch a people, amongſt whom his Name is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, imployed for him, &amp; under him in the judicial ſuppreſſing of manifeſt corruptions and corrupters of his truth and worſhip, &amp; ſo in the wel managing of ſuch affairs as immediately concern himſelf and his kingdom? It is certain that with the Lord is no ſhadow of turning; he is ſtill as truly and as much the author of peace and righteouſneſſe, of purity in doctrine and worſhip amongſt ſuch as are called by his Name, as in the dayes of old. And it is moſt evident that the godly Magiſtrates of <hi>Judah</hi> laid out themſelves with Gods ſpecial approbation in the ſuppreſſing of open corruptions, and corrupters in point of divine worſhip, and acted zealouſly as Magiſtrates, for the well ordering of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs immediately concerning God and his kingdom amongſt the people, the hiſtories of <hi>Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> after his repentance plainly evidence ſo much: And who can ſhew when God razed that branch of the divine commiſſion by which theſe ſervants of God were guided and warranted in their actings, out of the grant which Chriſtian Magiſtrates have now from him for their authority? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, neither Great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and thoſe other Chriſtian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours whom the Lord made glorious in the Primitive times, by being inſtrumental to introduce and ſettle Chriſtianity in the world, who oft-times called, and preſided in councels for the well ordering of matters of religion, both in doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, nor any of thoſe Chriſtian Princes, by whom the Lord
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:166419:16"/> hath in later times graciouſly demoliſhed Antichriſtianity, and reſtored Goſpel truth and worſhip in ſeveral places of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> ever heard of any ſuch thing; which had it been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto them, would have bound up their hands from that bleſſed work wherein they travelled as Gods vicegerents upon earth, for the good of his Church, and the glory of his Name. And I confidently believe, that his eyes will fail, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever looks after it, before he find it in the book of God. Whereas ſome go about to put off the argument which is taken from the actings of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Judah,</hi> in things immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerning God and his kingdom, from concluding a like authority upon Chriſtian Magiſtrates, by ſaying that thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were types of Chriſt, and therefore that their actings in the things of God are to be looked upon as typical, and determinable at the death of Chriſt. Before ſuch men boaſt much of, and reſt in this their anſwer, they ſhould well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. Whether admitting the Magiſtrates of <hi>Judah,</hi> as the Magiſtrates of that peculiar people, to have been types of Chriſt to come, reigning over the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> for ever: Magiſtracy in general became thereby legally typical, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable at the death of Chriſt; for if it did not, as all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men acknowledge; but Magiſtracy retained the nature of a perpetual ordinance in the hands of typical Magiſtrates, ſo alſo their Magiſtratical actings might and did retain the nature of perpetual moral duties in general, though in the particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of them by ſuch perſons, they were ſome way typical. 2. Whether thoſe Magiſtrates of <hi>Judah,</hi> who unqueſtionably were types of our Saviour in his regal ſoveraignty, as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> were not repreſentative figures of him, as well in their righteous actings towards men, as in their religious actings towards God; The Scripture is moſt plain that they were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72,1,2,3,4. <hi>Eſay</hi> 32.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. and therefore their being types of Chriſt doth no more take them off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cloud to conduct Chriſtian Magiſtrates in their righteous, eminent, exemplary actings in the things of God, then in thoſe which appertain to men, wherein all of underſtanding look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as obliging preſidents to Chriſtian Magiſtrates. This being conſidered, ſheweth, that their anſwer who would not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:166419:16"/> have Chriſtian Magiſtrates obliged by the divinely approved practiſe of Godly Magiſtrates amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> to mind and act for God, according to the mind of God revealed in his word, in all things immediatly concerning him and his kingdom; when they ſay that the Magiſtrates of <hi>Judah</hi> were types of Chriſt, and therefore are not to be looked upon by Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrrates, as preſidents to which they are to conform themſelves in their Magiſtratical actings, is but a blind put before the eyes of the weak, who are not able to diſcern a moral duty, under a typical uſe and application of the ſame, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſtians may eaſily do. Upon the whole, I cannot but apprehend that Chriſtian Magiſtrates in their place, have a ſpecial part belonging to them in the honourable diſcharge of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Saviour for the good of his Church, <hi>Song</hi> 2.15. <hi>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, which ſpoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</hi> And I believe that if any prevailingly intice or terrifie Chriſtian Magiſtrates by fair or menacing words, from the conſcience of yielding obedience to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, they will not be their ſufficient advocates at the bar of the Lord Jeſus, when they ſhall be there impleaded for ſinful neglect of that their duty towards God, to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the damage of his people. I can therefore as yet judge no otherwiſe of their attempt, but as very pernicious, and antiſcriptural, who that they may not ſeem to idolize Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, ſtick not to make meer idols of them, as to all things <hi>immediately reſpecting God and his kingdom,</hi> not ſuffering them, though they have eyes, and ears, and feet, and hands, to ſee, or hear, or ſtir, or act any thing magiſtratically for God in ſuch affairs as immediately concern himſelf, and his kingdom: If ſuch ſtudious obſtructers of magiſtratical adminiſtrations in the things of God according to truth, charity, and righteouſneſs, do look for thanks from God or men, for their attempt; I am greatly miſtaken if they be not greatly diſappointed of their hope, when they look with ſtrongeſt expectation to have it accompliſhed unto them. Beſides, if as Mr <hi>Dell</hi> here affirms the <hi>Lord is alwayes immediate moderatour and governour himſelf in all ſuch affairs, as immediately concern himſelf and his kingdom;</hi> then not only civil magiſtrates, but all Churches and Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:166419:17"/> officers whatſoever are diſcharged from attempting, under God, in Eccleſiaſtical ways, to protect the truth and worſhip of God, and endeavouring the ſuppreſſion of what is contrary to the ſame, which is certainly very diſſonant from the judgement, and practiſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. verſ. 3, 4. and verſ. 19, 20.</p>

                  <p>And thus you ſee, th t the <hi>Living word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which dwelt in the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt, did truly Crucifie and deſtroy the <hi>proper</hi> will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>whole life</hi> of his fleſh.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Am</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>crucified with Christ,</hi> that is, with that <hi>Humane nature</hi> of his that was taken up into the <hi>Word.</hi> Now as the moſt <hi>excellent</hi> crucifying of Chriſt, was through the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> that dwelt in him: ſo likewiſe the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> crucifying of all the <hi>faithful,</hi> is through the ſame Word and Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in <hi>them. (A)</hi> For to have the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:166419:21"/> Chriſt, that is, the Word and Spirit that is <hi>true God,</hi> dwelling in us, is the <hi>greatest crucifying</hi> of fleſh and bloud that can be. And when we are <hi>thus</hi> cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Chriſt, by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> dwelling in us, then afterwards, the <hi>body</hi> will be ready and willing to <hi>ſuffer</hi> the croſſe, or fire, or Lions, or racks, or torments, or any thing, as we ſee in the bleſſed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who if they had not been <hi>firſt</hi> crucified with Chriſt, through the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> had never deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up their <hi>bodies</hi> ſo readily as if they had not known them, to ſuffer ſo many <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>intollerable</hi> things for Chriſt. For <hi>that fleſh</hi> that is truly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is <hi>fitted</hi> for <hi>all</hi> ſufferings, though never ſo grievous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us <hi>learn, (B)</hi> That no <hi>outward</hi> ſorrows, or tribulations, or priſons, or rackings, or killings, are ſuch <hi>real crucifyings</hi> to a believer, as his <hi>faith, hope,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> the fruits of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in him, which will not ſuffer him to live in <hi>himſelf,</hi> or in the <hi>creature,</hi> but do carry him with <hi>great force</hi> out of all theſe things to live in <hi>God;</hi> which thing is the greateſt <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>crucifying</hi> of the fleſh that can be.</p>
                  <p>And as Chriſts <hi>outward crucifying</hi> on the croſſe, without his <hi>inward</hi> crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Word of God, had been <hi>nothing worth;</hi> no more would all the <hi>ſufferings</hi> and <hi>Martyrdoms</hi> of all the believers in the world, be of any <hi>worth</hi> in themſelves, or of any <hi>account</hi> with God, without this <hi>inward, ſpiritual, daily,</hi> and <hi>conſtant crucifying,</hi> ſuffering and Martyrdom of theirs. <hi>(C)</hi> Seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> reſtrain, hamper, mortifie, crucifie, kill, and deſtroy the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and all the corruptions, luſts and affections of it, as the <hi>living Word</hi> and <hi>ſpirit do. (D)</hi> And this is the <hi>glorious croſſe</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Body, as well as of <hi>Christ</hi> the Head; without which, all <hi>Martyrdom</hi> is nothing; and of which, all the <hi>bodily</hi> ſufferings and torments of the <hi>Saints,</hi> have been but a <hi>demonſtration</hi> to the world for the <hi>glory</hi> of God, and for the <hi>comfort, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> of other Chriſtians. And where this <hi>inward crucifying</hi> hath not been <hi>first</hi> wrought and accompliſhed, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could ſuffer nothing <hi>outwardly:</hi> as hath been very evident in many Chriſtians, who having in times of <hi>perſecution</hi> been called forth to witneſſe the truth with their <hi>lives,</hi> have at firſt, for fear and dread of the outward <hi>croſſe,</hi> abjured the truth to ſave their lives. But <hi>afterwards</hi> when the Word and Spirit <hi>within</hi> them, had truly and fully <hi>crucified them,</hi> they would then come forth again of their own <hi>accord,</hi> and willingly offer up their <hi>bodies</hi> to fire and death.</p>
                  <p>And thus alſo I have declared what <hi>is our crucifying with Chriſt,</hi> (E) <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying here, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt;</hi> becauſe his ſins were ſubdued, and his <hi>nature</hi> conquered through the <hi>living word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt dwelling in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(F)</hi> Now that both theſe things are ſo in <hi>truth,</hi> and that they are no <hi>fond notions, ſpeculations,</hi> and <hi>gloſſes</hi> of mine own <hi>deviſing,</hi> I will yet make it <hi>more</hi> evident by ſome few other plain Scriptures: as by that of <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. where he ſaith, <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin;</hi> that is, the <hi>preſence</hi> of Chriſt that is the living Word of God within us, is the killing and crucifying of the <hi>body</hi> to all ſin. And in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts of it:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 25. he ſhews, that this crucifying of the fleſh of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is not brought about by any <hi>outward ſorrows and ſufferings,</hi> but by the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:166419:21"/> 
                     <hi>preſence</hi> of the Spirit in it, ſaying, <hi>if we live in the ſpirit, let us alſo walk in the ſpirit:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 16. of the ſame chapter, he ſaith, <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the ſpirit and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye through the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> So again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. <hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection.</hi> Now <hi>all believers,</hi> without exception, are planted with Chriſt into <hi>a likeneſſe of his death;</hi> which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if all ſhould be crucified on a <hi>material</hi> Croſſe, as he himſelf was: but that all of them are <hi>buried with him by Baptiſm into his death,</hi> that is, by the <hi>baptiſm of the ſpirit;</hi> and the baptiſm of the Spirit, is the <hi>death</hi> of the fleſh; it is the death of <hi>our</hi> fleſh with Chriſts: for <hi>thus</hi> was <hi>Chriſts</hi> fleſh made dead to it ſelf, to ſin, and the world, to wit, through the <hi>Baptiſm of the ſpirit;</hi> and thus alſo is <hi>ours:</hi> wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> adds, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin:</hi> So that it is plain, that the <hi>deſtruction of ſin</hi> in our bodies by the living Word and Spirit of God, is <hi>our crucifying with Christ.</hi> And <hi>verſe</hi> 11. the Apoſtle would have thoſe that are <hi>thus</hi> crucified with Chriſt, <hi>to reckon themſelves dead to ſin,</hi> for as the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God in <hi>Christ</hi> made him wholly dead to <hi>ſin,</hi> and ſin had no place in him: So likewiſe, as far as the ſame <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt prevail in <hi>us,</hi> they will make <hi>us</hi> dead to <hi>ſin</hi> for the time <hi>paſt,</hi> and <hi>preſent;</hi> and for the <hi>future</hi> will <hi>preſerve</hi> us from ſin.</p>
                  <p>And now we ſhall make ſome <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this point.</p>

                     <hi>(G)</hi> Firſt, Then let us know that it is not enough <hi>to Salvation</hi> to believe, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt according to his humane nature, was outwardly crucified on a croſſe for us at Jeruſalem, except we alſo our own ſelves be crucified with him, through his living Word and Spirit dwelling in us:</hi> through which we muſt be powerfully <hi>planted</hi> into a true likeneſſe of his death, in ſuch ſort that we muſt be <hi>dead</hi> unto all <hi>ſin whatſoever,</hi> even to all our own corruptions and luſts; and to all the Corruptions that are in the world through luſt; and we muſt be dead to <hi>our ſelves;</hi> to our own fleſhly reaſon, underſtandig, will, deſires, ends, and to our whole humane life; and we muſt be dead to the world, and to all that is in it, and of it; to all the pleaſures, profits, and honours of it: we muſt thus truly be <hi>dead</hi> with Chriſt, ere we can <hi>live</hi> with him. And with this kind of crucifying muſt <hi>whole Chriſt</hi> be crucified, from the <hi>Head</hi> to the loweſt <hi>members:</hi> &amp; thus alſo muſt we be crucified with him, if we will have any part in him; I ſay, <hi>we muſt have fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings, and be made conformable to him in his death, ere ever we can attain to his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>(B)</hi> Whence it is manifeſt, that the <hi>living Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt in a Chriſtian do ſo kill the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>fleſh</hi> (which is a life of ſin and ſorrow, and darkneſſe, and death) that at the ſame time they <hi>communicate</hi> to the <hi>ſame</hi> man, to the <hi>ſame</hi> ſoul and body, a <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> and <hi>eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(C)</hi> For no man is <hi>crucified</hi> with Chriſt, but he alſo <hi>lives</hi> with him: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ſame Word</hi> that <hi>kils</hi> our <hi>life,</hi> communicates Chriſts: and Chriſt <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> us with himſelf, not that he may <hi>kill</hi> us, but that he may <hi>quicken</hi> us: and our <hi>quickning</hi> is the <hi>end</hi> of our crucifying, and our <hi>crucifying</hi> is the way to our quickening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(D)</hi> Indeed the killing of the fleſh by the <hi>ſword</hi> or <hi>famine,</hi> or the <hi>Law,</hi> or any way elſe is <hi>death</hi> indeed, or <hi>death unto death;</hi> but the killing of the fleſh by the <hi>living Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is its crucifying with Chriſt, is <hi>death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here again we may note this alſo, That the <hi>true life</hi> of a Chriſtian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins from his <hi>crucifying</hi> and dying with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and alſo the <hi>true crucifying</hi> and dying of a Chriſtian begins from his <hi>life</hi> in Chriſt. For <hi>both</hi> theſe inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably go together, to wit, our <hi>crucifying</hi> and our <hi>quickening</hi> with Chriſt. But our <hi>crucifying</hi> with Chriſt is named firſt in <hi>order,</hi> becauſe it is firſt in <hi>manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,</hi> ſeeing after we believe, Chriſts <hi>death</hi> is firſt <hi>manifeſted</hi> in us, before Chriſts <hi>life;</hi> though <hi>Chriſts life</hi> be firſt in us in order of <hi>nature:</hi> the <hi>crucifying</hi> of our <hi>fleſh,</hi> flowing from the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then is the <hi>ſum</hi> of this matter, <hi>(E)</hi> That the <hi>living Word</hi> dwelling in us, deſtroyes the <hi>proper life</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and takes up the <hi>fleſh</hi> into the <hi>life</hi> of it ſelf and the Spirit. And ſo a man in union with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath his <hi>own life</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed out of him, and <hi>Christs</hi> own life <hi>communicated</hi> to him. So that in the <hi>true Believer,</hi> the ſoul and body of <hi>man</hi> live in the life of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as was done in the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt our elder Brother.</p>
                  <p>And thus the <hi>fleſh</hi> lives a life that is not of the fleſh; yea thus the <hi>creature</hi> lives in it ſelf the life of <hi>God.</hi> For as that <hi>eternal life</hi> that was with the <hi>Father,</hi> was <hi>manifeſted</hi> in the <hi>Son,</hi> that is in his <hi>fleſh</hi> or <hi>humanity,</hi> and all Believers have ſeen and known it; ſo alſo that <hi>very</hi> life of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> is both <hi>communicated</hi> to the Saints, and alſo <hi>manifeſt</hi> in them, as <hi>faith</hi> very well knows. <hi>(F)</hi> And this is the great <hi>myſtery</hi> of the Goſpel; let them receive it, that can receive it.</p>

                  <p>(E) It is true, if we were perſons by <hi>our ſelves,</hi> theſe evils and enemies would be too hard for us; but being <hi>drawn unto Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>Father,</hi> and being by him alſo <hi>implanted in Chriſt,</hi> and made <hi>Branches</hi> of that <hi>Vine,</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Perſon,</hi> we thus become one with him who is <hi>conquerour</hi> of all things, and we <hi>our ſelves</hi> alſo are <hi>more</hi> then Conquerours in him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us all know that in the matter of our <hi>Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification,</hi> and of our whole <hi>Salvation, (F) Prorſus abjicienda eſt perſona,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>We must wholly caſt away our own perſon,</hi> and be united into <hi>one</hi> perſon with Chriſt, yea, and loſe our perſon in his: ſeeing <hi>out</hi> of this union Chriſt profits no body, either to the <hi>eſcaping</hi> ſin and death, or to the <hi>obtaining</hi> righteouſneſſe and life.</p>

It ſeems to me moſt evident, that the nature of regeneration, renovation, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification,

(D) that Chriſt in a believer <hi>is not the fleſh of Chriſt, for that being a creature, can be but in one place at a time, but this Chriſt is the Eternal Word and Son of the living God, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:166419:34"/> power, wiſdom, and righteouſneſſe of God and the true God and eternal life,</hi> ſeems to me a very dreadful poſition; For if a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſoul and body be taken up into the nature and perſon of Chriſt the Son of God in diſtinction from his fleſh, then he muſt needs in nature and perſon be the Son of God, and the true God, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is; which I am not willing to believe that Mr <hi>Dell</hi> will poſitively and plainly affirm, though his words evidently ſpeak ſo much: Whereas it is here further aſſerted by Mr <hi>Dell,</hi> that <hi>in Chriſt a believer ſubſiſts, lives, and acts as a member in the man, &amp; the branch in the Vine,</hi> that is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in a Scripture ſence, <hi>ſc.</hi> that a believer hath his ſpiritual life wholly in Chriſt, and from Chriſt as his head and mediatour, through his ſpirit, as <hi>a member hath its life from a man, and a branch from the Vine;</hi> but from hence to conclude that a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver through faith doth <hi>loſe his perſonality, and lives in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; perſonality of the Son of God,</hi> is utterly inconſequent; for though a believer doth retain his humane nature and perſonality, and doth truly live and ſubſiſt in the ſame, yet is it likewiſe true, that <hi>that</hi> perſon ſubſiſts, lives, and acts in Chriſt, as to the life of God in him, as <hi>a member in the man, or as a branch in the Vine.</hi>

That as that Word that was with God, and was God, and dwelt in <hi>the humanity of Chriſt,</hi> was that <hi>very</hi> life of his humanity; So the ſame Word of God dwelling in <hi>us</hi> through Chriſt, is alſo <hi>our</hi> life as it was <hi>his.</hi> And as the body hath no <hi>habit of life</hi> in it ſelf diſtinct and apart from the reaſonable <hi>ſoul;</hi> but the ſoul it ſelf that dwels in the body, is the life of the body; and when the <hi>ſoul</hi> withdraws the <hi>body</hi> is dead, and

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>(B)</hi> We may learn that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a believer, is to him inſtead of all <hi>cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted habits of Grace.</hi> Chriſt who is the true God, is <hi>all in all</hi> in a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and ſo a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> partakes of <hi>that</hi> righteouſneſſe which is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> of that <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which is <hi>Christ;</hi> of that <hi>power, truth, goodneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> which is <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> that dwels in believers, is truly <hi>all Grace</hi> to them. And herein they are like unto Chriſts <hi>humanity,</hi> unto whom the <hi>fulneſſe of the Godhead</hi> that dwelt in him, was inſtead of all <hi>created Grace.</hi> Wherefore let us know, that the <hi>created habits</hi> of grace in a <hi>Christian,</hi> which the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have invented and taught, and <hi>others</hi> have received from them, are nothing but the <hi>Empty notions,</hi> and <hi>Vain ſpeculations</hi> of carnal and unbelieving hearts, ignorant of the true myſtery of the Goſpel. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> that lives in a believer, is <hi>all Grace</hi> to him; and thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teacheth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. where ſpeaking of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>He is made unto us of God wiſdom, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption;</hi> and ſo a <hi>Christian</hi> hath that Wiſdom, Righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. which is <hi>Christ himſelf.</hi> And this grace which is <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> is infinitely more <hi>high</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> then all <hi>created habits of Grace, (C)</hi> and this is the <hi>only</hi> Grace that is <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, and that makes <hi>us</hi> accepted in it ſelf, <hi>(D)</hi> and this is the <hi>only</hi> grace againſt which <hi>the Gates of hell</hi> cannot prevail; and the <hi>only</hi> grace that can make us <hi>meet</hi> for the Fathers Kingdom. And thus you ſee that Chriſt that lives in a believer is <hi>all grace</hi> in him, and <hi>all-ſufficient</hi> grace for him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>(E)</hi> If <hi>Chriſt</hi> live in <hi>believers,</hi> then certainly whatever evils, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and perſecutions are brought upon <hi>believers,</hi> by the World and the falſe Church, for <hi>the word of faith,</hi> they are brought upon <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> is ſtill perſecuted in the <hi>fleſh</hi> throughout all Ages and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: and the <hi>faithful</hi> in all Ages are filling up the <hi>remainders</hi> of the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>body.</hi> For <hi>believers</hi> have all along ſuffered, and do ſtill ſuffer from the World, becauſe <hi>God is in them of a truth;</hi> and the evil done to <hi>them</hi> is againſt <hi>God himſelf,</hi> who dwells in them.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> who lives in <hi>believers,</hi> lives in them like <hi>himſelf,</hi> that is, like <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> and ſo thoſe in whom he lives,

                  <p n="2">2.

Might the Scriptures be heard, I think, <hi>created graces</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:166419:39"/> Chriſt in believers, would not be oppoſed or confounded; but Chriſt dwelling in believers by his ſpirit be acknowledged, not <hi>to be all grace,</hi> but the fountain of all <hi>created graces</hi> in them; for of his fulneſſe have we all received, and unto every one of us is grace given, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.7.

And again, it is true that the humanity of our Saviour, through the grace of <hi>perſonal union,</hi> was immediately joyned unto God; yea, ſo far into God, that by communication of properties, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bloud was the bloud of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and his humane life the life of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. yet had the <hi>humanity of our Saviour a proper life of its own, diſtinct from the life of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word,</hi> which humane life he laid down for us: our Saviour had not been in all things <hi>made like to us</hi> his brethren, which is affirmed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. if he had not in his <hi>humane nature</hi> lived an humane life, immediately reſulting from the union of his humane ſoul and body, as all other children of men do: If his humane nature had lived <hi>immediately in God,</hi> and ſo neceſſarily the life of God, it would have been, not only as it was, the <hi>nature of God,</hi> but <hi>the divine nature,</hi> which certainly it was not, being both paſſible, and mortal.

                  <p n="2">2. As faith is <hi>wrought</hi> in us by <hi>God,</hi> and is his <hi>conſtant</hi> work in us, ſo this <hi>faith</hi> doth apprehend <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even the <hi>Divine nature</hi> of Chriſt in the <hi>Humane;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>living God</hi> in the Son of <hi>man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews here, ſaying, <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God:</hi> Shewing that the <hi>chief thing</hi> that <hi>faith</hi> reſpects, and apprehends in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. ſaith that the faithful, <hi>through Chriſt, do believe in God who raiſed him from the dead.

                  <p>And thus from theſe <hi>two</hi> things we may in ſome meaſure underſtand the true <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> which is nothing but this.

                  <p>The <hi>first thing</hi> here conſiderable, is <hi>Chriſts ſpecial love to ſome above others;</hi> Who loved me.</p>
                  <p>Moſt certain it is from the <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (which is the <hi>trueſt</hi> and <hi>cleareſt light</hi> that ever ſhone in the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>faithful</hi>) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not love <hi>all</hi> Mankinde alike, but he loves ſome and <hi>not</hi> others.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>common love</hi> of Chriſt, wherein he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends <hi>all Mankinde</hi> alike, which he manifeſts to them in making (as he himſelf ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24.) his <hi>ſun to riſe on the evil, and on the good; and ſending his rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt;</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>He doth good to all Nations,</hi> though they walk in their own wayes; <hi>giving them rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their bodies with food, and their hearts with gladneſſe;</hi> and ſupplying them with the <hi>common</hi> things of <hi>this</hi> life, ſutable to their <hi>Humanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he hath a <hi>ſpecial love</hi> to his <hi>Elect,</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> which is his <hi>Body;</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:166419:47"/> theſe he loves as his <hi>own fleſh;</hi> yea, as partakers of the ſame <hi>Divine Nature</hi> with himſelf; and according to <hi>this</hi> love he communicateth to <hi>theſe,</hi> of all that very <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which he hath received from his <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now with this <hi>ſpecial love,</hi> he loves not <hi>all</hi> Mankinde <hi>alike,</hi> but onely <hi>ſome,</hi> paſſing by the <hi>reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> of which <hi>ſpecial love</hi> of his to <hi>ſome,</hi> and not to <hi>others,</hi> are theſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>Son,</hi> as he is of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> ſo he is alſo of the ſame <hi>operation</hi> with him, and ſo he <hi>only</hi> doth that which his <hi>Father</hi> doth <hi>first;</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf teſtifieth of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. ſaying, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſees the Father do. For whatſoever things he doth, theſe doth the Son likewiſe. For the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things that himſelf doth:</hi> So that the <hi>Father</hi> ſheweth to the <hi>Son</hi> all thoſe whom he <hi>loves;</hi> and whom the <hi>Son</hi> ſees the <hi>Father</hi> loves, thoſe alſo doth <hi>He</hi> love: and whom the <hi>Father</hi> doth not love, neither doth the <hi>Son</hi> love <hi>them,</hi> becauſe he can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the <hi>Father</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Sons love</hi> is full as large as the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but no larger, ſeeing <hi>both</hi> love with the <hi>ſame Spirit.</hi> For if the <hi>Father</hi> ſhould love <hi>ſuch</hi> onely, and the <hi>Son</hi> love <hi>others</hi> over and above; or if the <hi>Father</hi> ſhould love <hi>more</hi> then the <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>Son</hi> love <hi>more</hi> then the <hi>Father,</hi> this would breed a <hi>difference</hi> in God, which cannot be imagined without <hi>higheſt blaſphemy.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe whom the <hi>Father</hi> loves with this <hi>ſpecial</hi> love, the <hi>Son</hi> loves likewiſe, and none but theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the <hi>Son</hi> loves thoſe <hi>only</hi> whom the <hi>Father</hi> loves, ſo he loves them only upon this <hi>account</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>Fathers:</hi> as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and all that are mine are thine, and all that are thine are mine;</hi> and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> owns no more then are the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and thoſe which are the <hi>Fathers</hi> he takes them as his <hi>own,</hi> and loves them as the <hi>Father</hi> loves them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> loves them only with this <hi>ſpecial love,</hi> whom the <hi>Father</hi> loves, and loves them becauſe they are the Fathers, ſo he loves them <hi>as dearly</hi> as the <hi>Father</hi> loves <hi>him:</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith of theſe to his Father, <hi>Thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me:</hi> Again he ſaith, <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them, and I in them.</hi> And ſo, as <hi>God</hi> loves <hi>theſe</hi> as he loved <hi>Christ</hi> (and he doth not love all Mankinde ſo) ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> loves <hi>them</hi> as he loves <hi>himſelf;</hi> yea, he ſeems to love them <hi>more</hi> then <hi>himſelf;</hi> for <hi>he loves them, and gives himſelf for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo having ſpoken of <hi>Chriſts ſpecial love,</hi> I proceed in the next place, to ſpeak of the <hi>wonderful fruit</hi> of it, which is, his <hi>ſpecial Redemption:</hi> And <hi>gave himſelf for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(B) Christ</hi> could not love his as his <hi>Father</hi> loved <hi>him,</hi> even with the <hi>Infinite</hi> and moſt <hi>tender love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and ſtill ſuffer them to remain under the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and the power of the <hi>Devil:</hi> but he being the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and ſo <hi>able,</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of God within him made him willing, yea, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to <hi>redeem</hi> them. And this <hi>Redemption</hi> he could no otherwiſe bring about, then by <hi>giving himſelf for them:</hi> And ſo he gave himſelf for them <hi>indeed,</hi> even to be made <hi>Sin</hi> for them, and a <hi>Curſe</hi> for them; yea, he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:166419:48"/> gave himſelf up to all the <hi>ſorrows</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for them, and to endure to the very <hi>utmoſt,</hi> the whole <hi>wrath</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p>And this was the <hi>greateſt</hi> manifeſtation of the <hi>ſpecial love</hi> of Chriſt that could be: as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Herein was love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and laid down his life for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>further,</hi> we muſt know that as there is a <hi>general love,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> bears to all <hi>Mankinde:</hi> So alſo there is a <hi>general Redemption</hi> proportionable to that <hi>general Love;</hi> which is nothing elſe but this, the <hi>ſaving</hi> or <hi>reſcuing</hi> of the fallen and loſt world for a time, from the <hi>execution</hi> of that <hi>death</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> into which it had inwrapped it ſelf through <hi>Sin.</hi> but this is rather a <hi>Reprieve</hi> then a <hi>Redemption;</hi> and if it be called a Redemption, it is but the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>temporary</hi> Redemption of the <hi>World,</hi> during the <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering</hi> of God towards the Veſſels of Wrath, prepared for deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But after the <hi>determined time</hi> of Gods <hi>Patience</hi> is expired, the <hi>wrath</hi> of God breaks forth upon them, and <hi>death</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> ſwalloweth them up.</p>
                  <p>But the ſpecial <hi>Redemption</hi> of the Church, is a <hi>full, perfect,</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Redemption of all the <hi>Elect</hi> of God from <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> by the <hi>Righteouſneſſe, life,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Son of the living God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto them: And this <hi>Special Redemption</hi> begins here in this life, as ſoon as ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwells in our hearts by faith; and it is perfected at the day of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Special Redemption</hi> extends it ſelf no further then the <hi>Special Love</hi> of the Son, and of the Father, as may appear thus.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the <hi>Special Redemption</hi> of Chriſt extends it ſelf no further then the <hi>Fathers Election,</hi> as the <hi>Fathers Election</hi> extends it ſelf no farther then his <hi>Good pleaſure,</hi> or the <hi>Counſel</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> which doth limit the <hi>Infiniteneſſe</hi> both of his Goodneſſe, Mercy, Wiſdom, and Power in all his outward Actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Creatures,</hi> both in their <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> as alſo in the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of all bleſſings towards them both <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then as the <hi>Fathers Election</hi> is limited by his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>good pleaſure,</hi> ſo the <hi>Sons Redemption</hi> is limited by the Fathers Election, and ſo the <hi>Sons redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> is full as <hi>large</hi> as the <hi>Fathers election,</hi> but no larger: for Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>That he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him:</hi> Now the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will</hi> was that Chriſt ſhould redeem all that he had <hi>Loved,</hi> and <hi>Elected,</hi> and <hi>Given</hi> to him, but no more: And ſo we muſt neceſſarily know the <hi>latitude</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Redemption; by knowing the <hi>Fathers love</hi> &amp; <hi>will</hi> in his <hi>election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Christ</hi> Redeems no more with his <hi>Special</hi> Redemption, then thoſe he loves with this <hi>Special</hi> Love: and thus he loves no more then the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> loves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſts <hi>Special Redemption</hi> of thoſe whom he loves with this <hi>Special</hi> love may be farther <hi>evidenced</hi> out of <hi>John</hi> 17. where Chriſt diſtinguiſheth all Mankinde into theſe two ſorts. <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>World,</hi> and they that were given him <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> and tels us that his <hi>interceſſion</hi> was not for the <hi>former,</hi> but onely for theſe <hi>latter;</hi> ſaying, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for thoſe that thou haſt given me out of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we muſt know that the <hi>Prieſtly office</hi> of Chriſt, conſiſteth of two parts; His <hi>Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion.</hi> For firſt he <hi>Offers</hi> himſelf a Sacrifice for his people, and then after that he <hi>prayes</hi> for them whom he had <hi>Redeemed</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:166419:48"/> by his blood. And his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is founded on his <hi>Oblation;</hi> and he never <hi>prayes</hi> for any but for thoſe whom he hath firſt <hi>Redeemed;</hi> and whom he hath not <hi>Redeemed,</hi> he <hi>prayes</hi> not for; and whom he <hi>prayes</hi> not for, he <hi>Redeemed</hi> not. And ſo Chriſt <hi>not praying for the world,</hi> it is evident he never <hi>died for the world:</hi> for he of courſe and neceſſity performs the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of his <hi>Prieſtly office,</hi> his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for all thoſe for whom he hath performed the <hi>first</hi> part of his <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> his <hi>Oblation</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> And for whom he doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> it is moſt certain that he never performed his <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> for them: and this is ſo <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> a Truth, that the fooliſh and vain <hi>Reaſonings</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of men ſhall never be able to prevail againſt it, nor yet the very <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus you have ſeen manifeſted to you, the <hi>Special Redemption</hi> of Chriſt, as well as his <hi>Special love,</hi> both which he extends not <hi>alike</hi> to all Man-kinde (as the <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſay) but only to thoſe whom his Father hath <hi>given</hi> him, which are not <hi>all</hi> Kindreds, Tongues, People, and Nations; but <hi>ſome</hi> out of <hi>every</hi> Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, which he hath <hi>loved,</hi> and <hi>redeemed</hi> to God by his blood.</p>

                  <p>And firſt we may obſerve what an <hi>excellent apprehenſion,</hi> and <hi>viſion</hi> of Chriſt true <hi>faith</hi> hath; namely, it looks on Chriſt, not as a <hi>Severe Judge,</hi> or <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> but as one who hath <hi>truly loved us, and given himſelf for us.</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Diſcovery</hi> and <hi>Viſion</hi> of Chriſt as <hi>this,</hi> will uphold our ſouls mightily in all our <hi>ſaddeſt,</hi> and <hi>darkeſt</hi> hours; and will preſerve us, that we be not ſwallowed up of <hi>Deſpair.</hi> Yea when we ſee Chriſt <hi>thus,</hi> nothing is ſo <hi>ſweet, lovely,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable</hi> to us, as <hi>He</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Satan</hi> and our <hi>evil Conſciences,</hi> will ever be repreſenting Chriſt <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> to us, to make him <hi>Dreadful</hi> and <hi>Terrible</hi> to our Souls: as <hi>Luther</hi> reports of a certain <hi>Doctor</hi> in his time, who apprehended that <hi>Chriſt ſtood at the right hand of his Father accuſing him for his ſins;</hi> and with the very horror, and <hi>agony</hi> of this apprehenſion, he <hi>pined</hi> away and <hi>died.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore let us not ſee Chriſt as <hi>Satan</hi> and our <hi>evil Conſciences</hi> repreſent him in the hour of Temptation, but as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> holds him forth, and then we ſhall ſee him to be ſuch an one <hi>who hath loved us, and given himſelf for us:</hi> And ſuch a knowledge of Chriſt will ſupport, and eſtabliſh us again in the worſt aſſaults that <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> can make againſt us.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, <hi>he loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, he found in me no <hi>Free-will;</hi> or <hi>Natural abilities;</hi> no <hi>good deſires, affections</hi> or <hi>ends;</hi> but he ſaw me wholly <hi>eſtrayed</hi> from God, wicked, abominable, and the captive of the <hi>Devil;</hi> and yet ſuch was his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> that notwithſtanding all this, <hi>he loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> And this was the <hi>victory</hi> and <hi>triumph</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> faith.</p>
                  <p>Now by this that hath been laſt ſaid, we may perceive that every man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would find ſomething in himſelf to bring to Chriſt, to make him <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> unto him; and that very few can believe <hi>That he loves <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s whilſt we are ſinners,</hi> and that <hi>whilst we are yet ſinners, Christ died for the ungodly.</hi>
